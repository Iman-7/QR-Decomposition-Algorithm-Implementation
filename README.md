# QR Decomposition Algorithm Implementation using C++
The project is basically a C++ code to obtain the QR-decomposition of an m × n matrix A using Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process, relative to a given inner product (entered by the user of your code).
## Requirements
- Make sure that your program first checks that the column-vectors of A are linearly independent! The output of your program must be the m × n orthogonal matrix Q and the n × n upper triangular matrix R.
